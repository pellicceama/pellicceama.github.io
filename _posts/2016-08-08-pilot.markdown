It only took me a quarter of a century! I have been meaning to claim my own piece 
of internet land for a while now.

While I'm not committing to a regular posting schedule, 
here you'll be able to find content on my latest projects 
and general areas of interest - my own contributions to internet history.

It's an interesting time in my life and I think we're living in extremely exciting times. 
Over the coming weeks, I'll be announcing my next set of initiatives :-)

For those of you who are interested, this blog and website use [Jekyll][jekyll] 
as a static site generator as well as other awesome [open source][open-source] 
front-end libraries. It will also be proudly freely hosted on [Github][github].

What is a launch post without the clich√© pilot picture and quote?

<i>"Per Ardua Ad Astra"</i>
